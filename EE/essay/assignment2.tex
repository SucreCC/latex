\section{Introduction}

In the 21st century, advancements in theory and computational power have rapidly propelled 
artificial intelligence (AI), especially in healthcare, drawing significant investments (see Figures 1.1 and 1.2). 
Proponents believe AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy, extend care to remote areas, and save doctors' 
time for more patient interaction \cite{frostPublicViewsEthical2022}. However, AI's potential to worsen 
health disparities due to biases has sparked ethical concerns about privacy, data ownership, biased system risks, 
and lack of human oversight \cite{onianiAdoptingExpandingEthical2023, katiraiEthicsAdvancingArtificial2023}. 
This text will explore these issues' origins and solutions.

\section{section1}
% Public may be both benificiaries of new HCAI technologies and the greatest sufferers of AI-related harms. The result highlight that there are still noticeable concerns about 
% implementing HCAI in diagnostics and treatment recommendations for patients eith both acute and chronic illnesses, even if these tools are used as a recommendation system under the 
% physician experience and wisdom. Individuals may still not be ready to accept and use HCAI \cite{esmaeilzadehPatientsPerceptionsHuman2021}. Patients and publics are important voices In
% developing effective and ethical AI governance, but engaging patients and pbulics meanigfully in research about ethical HCAI is challenging. Most people have no first hand experience with HCAI,
% and some are unfamiliar with the concept of AI in general, Pulics may have limited understaing of how HCAI may be implemented and limited knowledge about the potential wrongs and harms that coudld
% arise from implementing HCAI \cite{frostPublicViewsEthical2022}, which means The public, as an actor, has yet to become more aware of privacy, data ownership, and human rights.

The public stands to gain from new HCAI technologies but also faces the highest risk of 
AI-related issues. Concerns persist around HCAI's role in diagnosing and suggesting treatments 
for both acute and chronic conditions, despite physician oversight. Many are hesitant to embrace HCAI \cite{esmaeilzadehPatientsPerceptionsHuman2021}. 
Engaging patients and the wider public in ethical HCAI discussions is crucial yet challenging. 
Most lack direct HCAI experience or even a basic understanding of AI. Their limited insight into HCAI's 
application and the potential for harm highlights the need for greater awareness around privacy, data rights, 
and human rights \cite{frostPublicViewsEthical2022}, emphasizing the importance of informed public participation in AI governance.

\section{section2}
For doctors, doctors are in a very awkward position in the entire system. Healthcare artificial intelligence is patient-centered during its implementation.

On the one hand, artificial intelligence systems are said to be the solution for many highly skilled medical tasks 
where machines have the potential to surpass human capabilities, such as identifying normal and abnormal chest X-rays \cite{iniestaHumanRoleGuarantee2023}.
The transformative power of data technology has brought worries and fears to doctors. Machines and 
doctors seem to be placed on a double-edged balance to determine who will go and who will stay. 
They are afraid that they will be replaced by machines.
Or would disempowerment of clinicians, resulting in the development stage of HCAI, 
clinicians do not fully trust Artificial intelligen system or developers, ultimately affecting the performance of HCAI.


On the other hand, A national survey-based study in Turkey shows that most participants believed that ethical issues around data storage 
and reuse can be ignored. The perspectives of engineers and developers who create AI systems, as well as potential users (healthcare professionals) 
should be more comprehensively collected, In addition, 61.68\% of people believe that anonymity can protect privacy, 
and 70.66\% of participants believe that artificial intelligence systems do not discriminate \cite{ahunPerceptionsConcernsEmergency2023}
It is also necessary to mention its understanding of artificial intelligence ethics.




\section{section3}
(1) By educating the public and medical staff on artificial intelligence and related ethical issues, this will help 
to improve their awareness of privacy and human rights in artificial intelligence.
(2) By openly acknowledging the value of medical staff and respecting the decisions of clinicians, they realize that 
artificial intelligence is not a competitive relationship but a cooperative relationship, and the output of artificial 
intelligence is communicated to patients in a way that doctors can understand.

\section{Conclusion}
% The application potential of artificial intelligence in the medical field is huge, but in the era of artificial intelligence, 
% we should not forget that people are not just composed of data. Even when talking about personalized medicine, we should keep 
% asking ourselves: "Where are the people in AI-based personalized medicine?"
% Personhood is a profound concept related to phenomenal consciousness, intention, and free will. If clinical recommendations 
% automatically deployed by AI are directly integrated, this will preemptively prevent clinicians from developing their own clinical 
% judgment capabilities, which we humans do when developing AI tools.
% Artificial intelligence should be ensured to safeguard our health and well-being, and especially our dignity as human beings.


Artificial intelligence can do a lot in medicine, but we must remember that people are more than just data. 
Even with personalized medicine using HCAI, we need to keep asking, "Where do people fit into AI-based personalized medicine?" 
Being human involves deep ideas like awareness, purpose, and choice, which is important when we create AI tools. 
We should make sure AI helps our health and well-being, and respects our dignity as humans.
