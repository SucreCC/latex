\section{introduction}
For a comprehensive understanding of modeling biological neural networks, 
I recommend reading several seminal works. "Real-time computing without stable
 states: a new framework for neural computation based on perturbations" by Maass 
 et al. (2002) provides a framework for neural computation that departs from 
 traditional stable state computations. Additionally, Markram et al. (1997) 
 have contributed foundational knowledge on synaptic efficacy and its regulation. 
 To delve into contemporary neuromorphic computing systems, Mead (1990) and Meier (2015) 
 offer significant insights. Finally, for advancements in phase-change memory devices and 
 their application to neuromorphic computing, you might consider exploring the works of Tuma et al. 
 (2016) and Burr et al. (2017). These papers will offer a broad and detailed spectrum of 
 knowledge on the subject.

 For additional papers on modeling biological neural networks, you may look into 
 "Neuromorphic computing using non-volatile memory" by Burr et al. (2017), 
 which explores the application of non-volatile memory technology in neural network models, 
 and Davies et al. (2018) discuss "Loihi", a neuromorphic manycore processor with on-chip learning 
 capabilities. For a tutorial on brain-inspired computing using phase-change memory devices,
see the work by Sebastian et al. (2018). These papers are at the forefront of combining neuroscience 
with advanced computational technologies.

Certainly! Here are some recent significant papers related to the modeling of biological neural networks which you may find valuable:

1. A paper on "Reliable interpretability of biology-inspired deep neural networks" delves into how interpretations from neural networks can be influenced by the initialization of weights and the structure of the network itself. The study emphasizes the need for repeated network training to ensure robustness and reliability of interpretations (Nature Systems Biology and Applications).

2. The article "Deep learning incorporating biologically inspired neural dynamics and in-memory computing" discusses learning spatio-temporal patterns and the use of phase-change memristors, highlighting advancements in neuromorphic computing and its potential applications in biological neural network modeling (Nature Machine Intelligence).

3. In "Biologically informed deep neural network for prostate cancer discovery," researchers have presented a framework for outcome prediction and hypothesis generation in prostate cancer, demonstrating how a deep neural network can incorporate biological pathways to provide insights that could potentially be translated clinically (Nature).

4. For a more theoretical perspective, the arXiv paper "Learning biological neuronal networks with artificial neural networks: neural oscillations" provides insights into the parameters and simulations of spiking neural networks (SNNs), focusing on how they can be used to understand neural oscillations, which are crucial in various cognitive computations.

These papers offer a blend of practical applications, theoretical understanding, and the latest methodologies in the field. They reflect the current trends in harnessing deep learning and computational models to gain insights into biological neural networks and their functions.


\subsection{Background Context}
Neural networks in the biological realm are intricate and complex systems. They consist of neurons that communicate with one another, forming a network that processes information. The functionality and significance of such networks form the bedrock of our understanding of the brain's processing capabilities.
